# Face Mask Detection

Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning in Keras, Python and OpenCV on Images and Real Video Streams.

## Motivation:
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.
