## Motivation âš¡
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of â€˜with_maskâ€™ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

# Plotting Learning Curve ðŸ¤¯
`The learning curve is a visual representation of how long it takes to acquire new skills or knowledge.`

*The model is making some error while detecting the masks. Also due to some cutoff of the lady's face the haarcascade classifier is not able to detect her face.*
